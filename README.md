# Disease-Prediction-and-Medicine-Recommendation
This project is a prototype that predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms and recommends the top 3 medicines using data-driven insights.
- Preprocessed disease-symptom datasets using TF-IDF to highlight significant terms for disease classification, and trained multiple classifiers including SVM, achieving 98% accuracy.
- Conducted sentiment analysis on UCI Drug Review dataset (213k+ reviews for 3,671 unique drugs), using a 4-gram deep learning model.
- Normalized review metrics to rank and recommend drugs reliably.
